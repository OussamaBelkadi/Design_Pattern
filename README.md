# Design Patterns in Java

Welcome to the **Design Patterns** project! This repository serves as a practical laboratory for implementing and understanding various software design patterns using Java 21.

## 🎯 Project Aim

The primary goal of this project is to build a solid foundation in software architecture. Design patterns are tried-and-tested solutions to common problems in software design. By implementing them here, the aim is to:

1.  **Promote Code Reusability**: Learn how to structure code so it can be reused across different parts of an application.
2.  **Ensure Scalability**: Implement structures that allow the project to grow without requiring a complete rewrite.
3.  **Improve Maintainability**: Use industry-standard patterns to make the codebase easier to read, test, and debug.
4.  **Reduce Coupling**: Understand how to make components independent of each other.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each package within the `src` directory represents a specific design pattern implementation:

-   **[Factory Design](./src/FactoryDesign)**: Decoupling object creation from its usage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Language**: Java 21

## 📖 How to Navigate

Each pattern folder contains:
-   The core logic (Interfaces and Classes).
-   A specific `README.md` explaining the "What, Why, and How" of that particular pattern.
-   A `Main.java` (in the root or specific folder) to demonstrate the pattern in action.

*Happy coding! "Design patterns are not a silver bullet, but they are a very sharp tool."*
